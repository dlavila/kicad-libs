# kicad-libs

KiCad libraries used in my projects. Some of the components, footprints and 3d models are based on work by http://smisioto.no-ip.org/elettronica/kicad/kicad-en.htm

## Usage

Add this repository as a git submodule to your KiCad project directory. After creating a KiCad project, from your project directory use:

```
./kicad-libs/setup.py
```

to automatically add the component and footprint libraries to your project.
